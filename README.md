# Internship Prediction ML Project

This project predicts internship eligibility of candidates based on their profile features. The dataset includes details like age, education, experience, skills, and other relevant factors.

## Dataset
- File: `test.csv`
- Columns include candidate features required for prediction.
- Target: Internship eligibility (Yes/No)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading** – Load dataset into Python using Pandas
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand data distribution, missing values, and relationships
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numeric features
4. **Feature Engineering** – Create relevant features for better model performance
5. **Model Selection & Training** – Train models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
6. **Evaluation** – Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
7. **Prediction** – Predict internship eligibility for new candidates

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
